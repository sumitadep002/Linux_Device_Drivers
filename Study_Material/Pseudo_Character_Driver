What is Device _Driver?
-----------------------
Kind of an interface between HardWare and Application software

Types:
------
Character	:Keyboard, Mouse or any sensor which communicates in series of characters.
Block		:HDD, SSD or any memory device 
Network	:WIFI, Bluetooth or any network device

how to make device driver?
--------------------------
There will be a device file for each device in /dev/ directory

VFS: Virtual File Systems
-------------------------
Device drivers are being treated as files in linux
This is being cared by VFS
VFS works in kernel space

We have to implment our own Custom implementation of open, read, close, write and lseek.


Terminologies:
--------------

1. Device Number
There will be a number for devices
Major Number and Minor Number


Connection Establishment betn device file access and driver:
------------------------------------------------------------

Create Device Number: Combination of Major and Minor 
Create Device Files
Make a char device registration with the VFS (CDEV_ADD)
Implementat the driver's file operation method gor open, read, write and close, etc.



Kernel APIs:
------------
Creation:								Deletion:
alloc_chrdev_region() will create the device number dynamic		unregister_chrdev_region();

cdev_init() for registration of device with the VFS			cdev_dev();
cdev_add()

class_create() create device files					class_destroy();
device_create()							device_destroy();


Header files needed to use above API's:
---------------------------------------
linux/fs.h
linux/cdev.h
linux/device.h
linux/uaccess.h
linux/fs.h

MACROS:
-------

MINOR(device_number);
MAJOR(device_number);


parameters of APIs:
-------------------
int alloc_chrdev_region(dev_t *dev,unsigned baseminor,unsigned count,const char *name);

create a files and device structure:

strucct file_operations name;

struct cdev name;

initialise:
-----------
cdev_init(&name_of_device_structure,&name_of_file_operation_structure);

Registration of device to VFS:
------------------------------
cdev_add(&cdev_structure,device_number,count);

NOTE: Whenever a file opened a file object will be created
